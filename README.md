# A MXNet/Gluon implementation of MobileNetV2

This is a Gluon implementation of MobileNetV2 architecture as described in the paper [Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks: Mobile Networks for Classification, Detection and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381).


## Training
Please training using the gluon [image_classification interface](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/gluon/image_classification.py). 

## Accuracy in ImageNet
In the first epoch, we've got 14.314% validation accuracy in ImageNet 2012 dataset. We will release a pretrained model when we get the accuracy of the paper.
