# A MXNet/Gluon implementation of MobileNetV2

This is a Gluon implementation of MobileNetV2 architecture as described in the paper [Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks: Mobile Networks for Classification, Detection and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381).


## Training
For training, please using [this interface](https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet/blob/model_zoo/example/gluon/train_imagenet.py). 

## Accuracy in ImageNet
In the first epoch, we've got 20.181% validation accuracy in ImageNet 2012 dataset. We will release a pretrained model when we get the accuracy of the paper.
